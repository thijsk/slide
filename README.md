# About this repository

The Slide is a device that can be attached to a curtain rail to open and close the curtains. It can be controlled by a mobile app, and it can be integrated with home automation systems.

Unfortunately, the manufacturer of Slide will go out of business, so the cloud service that is used to control the Slide will be discontinued.

This repository documents all the information that I could find about the Innovation in Motion slide product, so that it can be used in a home automation system without the cloud service.
